	<p>This is a paragraph - very common. In older version of html, the closing tag was not required. Please, though, always include a closing paragraph tag. Thank you.</p>
	<blockquote>A block quote works like a paragraph, except it is usually indented and sometimes italic - depends on the browser.</blockquote>
	<p>Now, we look at lists.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Comments are great to add to your scripts.</li>
		    <!-- This is an html comment, It hides stuff from your browser. You can only see a comment if you look at the code -->
		<li>I will occasionally use CSS in addition to HTML.</li>
		<li>You, however, are not required to use any CSS. But it will make your page pretty.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>More HTML stuff</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Most common CSS is background color and centering.</li>
		<li>Then <span style="font-weight:bold">bold</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">italic</span> CSS is next, in terms of frequency of use</li>
		<li>However, you can use the <strong>strong</strong> and <em>em</em> as well as the &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt; tags for bold and italic.</li>
		<li>HTML <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_symbols.asp">special characters</a>: the &amp; is one such character</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Good Luck!</h3>
	<!-- The color:green is a CSS property:value pair. It is also the "value" of the style="" attribute of the <h3> tag. -->
